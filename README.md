Memorable or random password
Word file of available words
Number of characters
Number of words
Types of casing (uppercase, lowercase, etc)
Punctuation characters (yes or no)
Characters not allowed
If user wants to test the generators (yes or no)

# Expected Output
This program is expected to produce an output that contains generated passwords according to user input

# Type of Execution
This program involves the following types of execution:
Interactive Execution: allows users to specify their preferences when generating passwords
Memorable Password Execution: program reads from external word list to produce easy-to-remember passwords
Random Password Execution: program constructs random passwords based on user preferences and excluded characaters
Automated Testing Execution: program automates a stress-test that generates 1000 random passwords to ensure stability and accuracy
Error-Handling Execution: many try and excepts are used to avoid program crashes and guide users toward valid inputs

# Possible Improvements
Code could be more effectively organized by combining certain lines into one
Improved input validation
Cleaner and more organized output format
